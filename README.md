# YouTube Audio Mode

**Save bandwidth and enjoy distraction-free listening on YouTube.**

YouTube Audio Mode is a lightweight Chrome extension that transforms your YouTube experience by playing videos in audio-only mode. It intelligently forces the video quality to 144p and hides the video player, replacing it with a beautiful audio visualizer. This drastically reduces internet data usage, making it perfect for music streaming, listening to podcasts, or saving bandwidth on metered connections.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🎧 One-Click Audio Mode:** Toggle audio-only playback instantly with a simple switch or keyboard shortcut (`Alt+Shift+A`) for Windows and `Option+Shift+A` for macOS.
- **📉 Smart Data Saving:** Automatically sets video quality to **144p** to minimize bandwidth consumption while keeping audio clear.
- **📊 Usage Statistics:** Track exactly how much data you've saved compared to 720p/1080p, along with your total listening time.
- **🎵 Audio Visualizer:** A stunning, animated visualizer replaces the blank video screen.
- **🎨 Custom Themes:** Choose from 6 beautiful gradient presets or customize the background with your own colors or images.
- **🔒 Privacy Focused:** All data and preferences are stored locally on your device. No external tracking.
